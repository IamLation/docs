  <Step title="Create a new subfolder" stepNumber={2}>
    <Info>
      This is an optional step, but is _highly recommended_.
    </Info>
    If you haven't already, create a new subfolder named `[lation]` in your server's root resources directory. Unzip (_extract_) this script into the newly created `[lation]` subfolder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update server.cfg & perform a full restart" stepNumber={3}>
    Once all other steps are completed, open your `server.cfg` & add `ensure [lation]` to the very **bottom** of your resource start list. Finally, perform a full server restart. Failure to perform a full restart after installation will cause errors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Danger>
  Upon completion, do not delete the `install` folder or any `.sql` files or you will experience errors.
