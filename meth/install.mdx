  <Step title="Add items to your inventory">
    Open the `install` folder and add the `items` & their `images` to your inventory.

    <Note>
      You do not need to import the `.sql` file manually; it will be imported automatically.

  <Step title="Create a new subfolder">
    <Info>
      This is an optional step, but is _highly recommended_.
    </Info>
    If you haven't already, create a new subfolder named `[lation]` in your server's root resources directory. Unzip (_extract_) this script into the newly created `[lation]` subfolder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update server.cfg & perform a full restart">
    Once all other steps are completed, open your `server.cfg` & add `ensure [lation]` to the very **bottom** of your resource start list. Finally, perform a full server restart. Failure to perform a full restart after installation will cause errors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Danger>
  Upon completion, do not delete the `install` folder or any `.sql` files or you will experience errors.
