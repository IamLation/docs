  <Step title="Create a new subfolder" stepNumber={2}>
    <Info>
      This is an optional step, but is _highly recommended_.
    </Info>
    If you haven't already, create a new subfolder named `[lation]` in your server's root resources directory. Unzip (_extract_) this script into the newly created `[lation]` subfolder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add ACE permission" stepNumber={3}>
    Open your `server.cfg` and add the following ACE permission:

    ```
    add_ace group.admin lation_shops.admin allow
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update server.cfg & perform a full restart">
    Once all other steps are completed, open your `server.cfg` & add `ensure [lation]` to the very **bottom** of your resource start list. Finally, perform a full server restart. Failure to perform a full restart after installation will cause errors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Once completed, use the command `/shopadmin` in-game to get started!
