<Steps>
  <Step title="Add to 'resources' directory" stepNumber={1}>
    Extract the `lation_ui` zip folder directly into the root `resources` directory of your server.

    <Warning>
      Do not place this resource in a `[subfolder]` - it should be placed directly in the root.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update server.cfg">
    Open your `server.cfg` and add `ensure lation_ui` before _all_ other resources; including your framework!

    ```
    ensure lation_ui
    ensure qbx_core
    ensure [standalone]
    .. etc
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart server">
    Finally, perform a full server restart. Failure to perform a full restart after installation will cause errors.

  <Step title="Use our ox_lib">
    <Check>
      This is an optional but highly recommened step!
    </Check>
    We maintain an official fork of ox_lib that's identical to the original, but with one enhancement: automatic Modern UI detection. When Modern UI is installed, it uses it. When it's not, it works exactly like standard ox_lib - no configuration needed!

    <Icon icon="palette" /> **Beautiful UI** - _Automatic Modern UI styling is used when detected_\
    <Icon icon="rotate" /> **Drop-in Replacement** - _Works identical to standard ox_lib; because it is!_\
    <Icon icon="rocket" /> **Zero Coding** - _Automatically detects & switches to Modern UI_\
    <Icon icon="wrench" /> **Always Updated** - _Regularly syncs with official ox_lib releases_
