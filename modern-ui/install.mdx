<Steps>
  <Step title="Add to 'resources' directory" stepNumber={1}>
    Extract the `lation_ui` zip folder directly into the root `resources` directory of your server.

    <Warning>
      Do not place this resource in a `[subfolder]` - it should be placed directly in the root.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update server.cfg">
    Open your `server.cfg` and add `ensure lation_ui` before _all_ other resources; including your framework!

    ```
    ensure lation_ui
    ensure qbx_core
    ensure [standalone]
    .. etc
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart server">
    Finally, perform a full server restart. Failure to perform a full restart after installation will cause errors.
  </Step>
