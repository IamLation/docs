  <Accordion title="qbx_garages progress bar colours not displaying with lation_ui">
    This issue can occur when converting **qbx_garages** to use **lation_ui**, causing the engine, body, or fuel progress bar colours to not display correctly.

    Replace lines **6–10** in `qbx_garages/client/main.lua` with the following:

    ```lua
    local ProgressColor = {
        GREEN = 'green',
        YELLOW = 'yellow',
        RED = 'red'
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
